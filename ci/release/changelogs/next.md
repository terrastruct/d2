#### Features üöÄ

- Icons: connections can include icons [#12](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/12)
- Syntax: `suspend`/`unsuspend` to define models and instantiate them [#2394](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2394)
- Globs:
  - support for filtering edges based on properties of endpoint nodes (e.g., `&src.style.fill: blue`) [#2395](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2395)
  - `level` filter implemented [#2473](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2473)
- Render:
  - markdown, latex, and code can be used as object labels [#2204](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2204)
  - `shape: c4-person` to render a person shape like what the C4 model prescribes [#2397](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2397)
- Icons: border-radius should work on icon [#2409](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/2409)
- Diagram legends are implemented [#2416](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2416)

#### Improvements üßπ

- CLI:
  - Support `validate` command. [#2415](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2415)
  - Watch mode ignores backup files (e.g. files created by certain editors like Helix). [#2131](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/2131)
- Compiler:
  - `link`s can be set to root path, e.g. `/xyz`. [#2357](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/2357)
- Parser:
  - impose max key length. It's almost certainly a mistake if an ID gets too long, e.g. missing quotes [#2465](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2465)
- # Render: - horizontal padding added for connection labels [#2461](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2461)
- Themes [#2065](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2065):
  - new theme `Dark Berry Blue` (`205`), intended as dark variant of `Mixed Berry Blue` (`5`).
  - changed id of `Dark Flagship Terrastruct` (`203`) to mirror the ID of `Flagship Terrastruct` (`3`), improving theme discoverability.
