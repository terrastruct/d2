- `double-border` keyword implemented. [#565](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/565)
- The [Dockerfile](./docs/INSTALL.md#docker) now supports rendering PNGs [#594](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/594)
  - There was a minor breaking change as part of this where the default working directory of the Dockerfile is now `/home/debian/src` instead of `/root/src` to allow UID remapping with [`fixuid`](https://github.com/boxboat/fixuid).
