#### Features üöÄ

- Icons:
  - connections can include icons [#12](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/12)
- Syntax:
  - `suspend`/`unsuspend` to define models and instantiate them [#2394](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2394)
- Globs:
  - support for filtering edges based on properties of endpoint nodes (e.g., `&src.style.fill: blue`) [#2395](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2395)
  - `level` filter implemented [#2473](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2473)
- Render:
  - markdown, latex, and code can be used as object labels [#2204](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2204)
  - `shape: c4-person` to render a person shape like what the C4 model prescribes [#2397](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2397)
- Icons:
  - border-radius should work on icon [#2409](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/2409)
- Misc:
  - Diagram legends are implemented [#2416](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2416)

#### Improvements üßπ

- CLI:
    - Support `validate` command. [#2415](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2415)
    - Watch mode ignores backup files (e.g. files created by certain editors like Helix). [#2131](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/2131)
    - Support for `--omit-version` flag. [#2377](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/2377)
    - Casing is ignored for plugin names [#2486](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2486)
- Compiler:
    - `link`s can be set to root path, e.g. `/xyz`. [#2357](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/issues/2357)
    - When importing a file, attempt resolving substitutions at the imported file scope first [#2482](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2482)
    - validate gradient color stops. [#2492](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2492)
- Parser:
    - impose max key length. It's almost certainly a mistake if an ID gets too long, e.g. missing quotes [#2465](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2465)
- Render:
    - horizontal padding added for connection labels [#2461](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2461)

- Formatter:
  - fixes substitutions in quotes surrounded by text [#2462](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/pull/2462)
- CLI:
